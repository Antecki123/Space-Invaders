# Space-Invaders
#### Welcome to Space Invaders, a classic arcade game where you defend Earth against an alien invasion! Use your spaceship to shoot down the relentless wave of alien invaders and protect our planet from destruction.

## How to Play
1. Controls:
     * Use the ← and → arrow keys to move your spaceship horizontally (using A and D keys work as well).
     * Press the Spacebar to shoot lasers and destroy the invading aliens.

2. Objective:
     * Defeat all the aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen or destroy your spaceship.
     * Earn points for every alien you successfully eliminate.

3. Power-ups:
     * Occasionally, a power-up spaceship will appear. Shoot it down to acquire special abilities such as faster shooting or temporary shields. (TODO)

4. Alien Formations:
     * The aliens will move in formations and gradually descend towards your spaceship.
     * As you eliminate aliens, the remaining ones will increase in speed, making it more challenging to avoid their attacks. (TODO)

5. Lives:
     * You start with three lives. Be cautious not to let the aliens destroy your spaceship.

6. Game Over:
     * The game ends when all your lives are lost, and the aliens successfully invade Earth.
     * Try to achieve the highest score possible and challenge your friends to beat it!

### Enjoy the game and save Earth from the alien invasion! Good luck, Commander!
